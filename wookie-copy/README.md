Wookie
======
Wookie is an asynchronous HTTP server written in common lisp. It is not for
public use, yet. It's named after my dog who is extremely tempermental, 
image-conscious, and makes sounds like a wookie when you squeeze him. He views
himself as royalty, and we are all forever in his debt for his invaluable gift
of existing on the same planet as us. This project is dedicated to him.

Wookie borrows ideas from the excellent hunchentoot. In fact, it may eventually
turn into an asynchronous hunchentoot port, but it may also take its own road
depending on how divergent the two become. It's all undecided.

Wookie requires git versions of:


 - [cl-libevent2](/orthecreedence/cl-libevent2)
 - [cl-async](/orthecreedence/cl-async)
 - [http-parse](/orthecreedence/http-parse)

For the brave
-------------
```common-lisp
(ql:quickload :wookie)  ; make sure it's in your ASD path or local-projects/

(defpackage :wookie-test
  (:use :cl))
(in-package :wookie-test)

(wookie:defroute :GET "/" (http reply)
  (wookie:send-reply reply :body "Hello!"))

(as:start-event-loop
  (lambda ()
    (let ((acceptor (make-instance 'wookie:acceptor :port 8090)))
      (wookie:start-server acceptor)))
  :catch-app-errors t)
```

Wookie is barely even a prototype at this point. Follow the issues list for a
TODO overview.
